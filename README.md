This repository was initially just meant to simulate mechanics from Pathfinder RPG.
The goal for doing so was the rebalance some of the existing classes, such as
the Swashbuckler, who suffered from the classic "feast or famine" trope. Changes were
implemented at my table in order to give struggling classes a leg-up. Over time,
after various commits I simply chose to recreate Pathfinder's character creation entirely.
Is there an end goal? Nah, not really. Is it fun/nerdy? Yes, yes it is.
